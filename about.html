Following the success of FashionValet, Vivy Yusof launched dUCk on May 5th 2014 to convey the message that wearing scarves should be a celebrated ct among woman whether Muslim or not and since then has risen quickly in its popularity among scarf-wearers. Unique in presentation and packaging, dUCk is known to be different from the rest, something the team at dUCk take very seriously.


<font size="12"><font color="black"><b><p> How can come up with the idea of <font color="800000">FASHION<font color="grey">VALET?</p></b></font>

<font size="11"><font color="black"><p>Vivy Yusof and her husband studied at UK where online consumerism was a part of daily life. They enjoyed the convenience of shopping online and it soon took over the way they conventionally shopped. After graduating university and returning to Malaysia, they realised that e-commerce was non-existent at home back in 2010. After being frustrated at the lack of online shopping option available to Malaysians and always stuck in traffic jam and crowded parking lot, they decided to find out the solution. They talked to local designers and realised they were having challenges in reaching out to the masses and developing a solid customer base. Then, they create FashionValet to push Malaysia towards expanding its consumer habits, but also to promote local designers and their immense talent. </p></font>
